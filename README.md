# My-first-data-analysis-notebook
My first project in data analysis with `python` after my course of introduction to data analysis at fwd-Egypt with `Udacity`.
### This project is the analysis of a data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue. 

The original data set in kaggel is [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata&sa=D&ust=1532469042115000)
#### In this project I apply what learnt in an intro to data analysis course at Udacity.
>**As a summary to the project:**
- import the needed packages and libraries.
- read our data through a pandas dataframe.
- clean and treat the data from missed and nan data.
- explore the data to find insights.
- build conclusions of what we find.
